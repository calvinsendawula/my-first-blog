# Invincible Blog

This is a project done in Django with Python. It is a web application for a blog running on SQLite and is also fully hosted online. 

The blog is based on the final episode of Invincible - the Amazon original series (Season 1).

The posts were generated by ChatGPT after training it with data from the show's script and character stories from the official comics.
